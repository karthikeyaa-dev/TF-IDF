# TF-IDF Explained in Depth (Beginner Friendly)

## What is TF-IDF?

**TF-IDF** stands for **Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency**. It’s a way to measure how important a word is in a document relative to a collection of documents (called a *corpus*).

### Why do we need TF-IDF?

* Some words (like “the”, “is”, “and”) appear in almost every document — these don’t help tell documents apart.
* Words that appear a lot in **one specific document**, but rarely elsewhere, are usually more important for understanding that document.
* TF-IDF helps us find those important, distinguishing words.

## Step 1: Term Frequency (TF)

Term Frequency tells us **how often a word appears in a document**, relative to the total words in that document.

### Formula:

$$
\text{TF}(t, d) = \frac{\text{Number of times term } t \text{ appears in document } d}{\text{Total number of terms in document } d}
$$

* ( t ) = the term (word)
* ( d ) = the document

### Intuition:

* If a word appears frequently in a document, it might be important for that document.
* But just counting raw occurrences isn’t enough because longer documents might have higher counts.

## Step 2: Inverse Document Frequency (IDF)

IDF tells us **how unique or rare a word is across all documents**.

### Formula:

$$
\text{IDF}(t, D) = \log \left( \frac{N}{1 + \text{Number of documents containing } t} \right)
$$

* ( N ) = total number of documents in the corpus ( D )
* Adding 1 in the denominator avoids division by zero if the term does not appear in any document.

### Why do we use the logarithm here?

* Without log, rare words would get *very* large scores and dominate everything.
* Logarithm **smooths** these values, so increases in rarity contribute less and less — this is called *diminishing returns*.
* It keeps the score in a manageable range and more stable.

---

## Step 3: TF-IDF Score

We multiply Term Frequency and Inverse Document Frequency to get the TF-IDF score:

$$
\text{TF-IDF}(t, d, D) = \text{TF}(t, d) \times \text{IDF}(t, D)
$$

### What does this mean?

* A **high TF-IDF score** means the term is important in this document (high TF) and rare across other documents (high IDF).
* A **low TF-IDF score** means the term is either common everywhere or not very important in this document.

## Example: Calculating TF-IDF for the word *“cat”*

Imagine we have these 3 documents:

1. "the cat sat on the mat"
2. "the dog sat on the log"
3. "the cat chased the dog"

### Step 1: Term Frequency of "cat" in Document 1

* Document 1 has 6 words in total.
* "cat" appears 1 time.

$$
\text{TF}(\text{cat}, d_1) = \frac{1}{6} \approx 0.167
$$

### Step 2: Inverse Document Frequency for "cat"

* "cat" appears in 2 documents (Doc 1 and Doc 3).
* Total documents = 3.

$$
\text{IDF}(\text{cat}, D) = \log \left( \frac{3}{1 + 2} \right) = \log(1) = 0
$$

### Step 3: Calculate TF-IDF

$$
\text{TF-IDF}(\text{cat}, d_1, D) = 0.167 \times 0 = 0
$$

**Interpretation**: Even though "cat" appears in Document 1, it also appears in many other documents, so its TF-IDF score is low — it is not a unique, distinguishing word here.

| ------------------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------- |
| **Term Frequency (TF)**              | $TF(t, d) = \frac{f_{t,d}}{n_d}$                     | Frequency of term *t* in document *d*                         | Captures local importance          |
| **Inverse Document Frequency (IDF)** | $IDF(t, D) = \log \left( \frac{N}{1 + df_t} \right)$ | Rarity of term *t* across corpus *D*                          | Downweights common words globally  |
| **TF-IDF**                           | $TF\text{-}IDF(t, d, D) = TF(t, d) \times IDF(t, D)$ | Importance of term *t* in document *d* considering corpus *D* | Highlights unique & frequent terms |


### Where:

* $f_{t,d}$ = Number of times term *t* appears in document *d*
* $n_d$ = Total terms in document *d*
* $N$ = Total number of documents in corpus *D*
* $df_t$ = Number of documents containing term *t*

## Why TF-IDF is Useful

* Helps search engines rank documents by relevance.
* Identifies keywords that best describe a document.
* Used in text classification, clustering, and information retrieval.
* Balances *local importance* (TF) and *global uniqueness* (IDF).
